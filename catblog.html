      <p>Perhcik is a two year old Manx, which is a kind of cat from the Isle of Mann off the coast of the U.K. He is really rambunctious, but also sweet. I was opposed to getting him at first, but we quickly became friends after my wife announced we were picking him up one day.</p>
        <ol> His favorite Toys are:
          <li>Kickers</li>
          <li>Fake Mice</li>
          <li>His Siblings</li>
        </ol>
      <h2>Where did his name come from?</h2>
        <p>His name comes from the famous movie "fiddler on the roof," which is about a poor Jewish family around the turn of the century in Rural Russia.</p>
